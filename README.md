### DOS Header:
PE files start with 64 bytes long structure called the DOS header, its what makes the PE FILE AN MS-DOS executable.

### DOS Stub: 
 DOS stub which is a small MS-DOS 2.0 compactible executable that prints an error message saying " this program cannot be run in DOS mode".

The NT headers part contains three main parts:
1. PE Signatures:  A 4-bytes signature that identifies the file as PE file.
2. File header: A standard COFF file header. It holds some information about the PE file.
3. Optional Header: The most important header of the NT  headers , its name is the optional header because some files donâ€™t have it, however its requires for image files. This header provides important information to the OS loader.
